This is the template for PhD and Master's Thesis given to Konya Food and Agriculture University.

In order to run this template, you need to set your LaTeX compiler as ```LuaLateX``` in Overleaf.

You need to fill in at least
```console
preamble.tex
```

The other files as follows:

``abbrev.tex``: List of Abbreviations

``cv.tex``: You CV (required for PhD, not required for Master's Thesis)

``supplementary.txt``: Additional material, tables, figures, pictures, that don't fit anywhere in the mail text.

``references.bib``: Your reference list in biblatex format.

You don't have to change anything in ``start.tex`` and ``end.tex`` unless the format changes radically.
